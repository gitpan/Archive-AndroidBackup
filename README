android backup utility
modelled after tar
repo: git@github.com:NathanielLLally/AndroidBackup.git

the motivation to this project stemmed from the evil that is motorola's moto-x 
tyranny in their bootlocker and filesystem security
I simply love games that get ported to android and maintain the same save game
format one can then easily transfer their progress between devices
this utility makes that simple

there is a java utility named the Android Backup Extractor which can be found
here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/adbextractor/

and another java tool here:
https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor

however, despising graphical applications and deriving enjoyment from perl
programming as i do, you now have abk
(apache people took 'ab' with the benchmarking tool, and mr Elenkov's tool is
  'abe')

  abk [op] file [dir]
    -t list table of contents
    -c create android backup named file from dir
    -x extract
    -v and list toc 

for those not yet aquainted with this android afterthought and wonderfully
clandestine way of transferring private application files, see the following
sample windows session:

NOTE: obtaining and setting up android developer bridge (adb) is out of scope
yet can be known from the listed references below

1: obtain the program's namespace

  adb shell pm list packages | find /I "baldur"

2: create a backup (see xda-devs article below for more info)

  adb backup -f bgeesave.ab com.beamdog.baldursgateenhancededition

3: extract

  abk -xv bgeesave.ab

...

4: create a new ab file from filesystem
  
  abk -c newsave.ab apps/

5: restore the backup

  adb restore newsave.ab
